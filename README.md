# ✨ Break-Reminder

A lighthearted Python project built to remind you (and myself) to take breaks — whether it's stepping away from the screen, touching some grass 🌱, or just laughing at how chaotic learning to code can feel sometimes. 😄

This repository contains two beginner-friendly scripts written in Python that use desktop notifications and pop-up windows to encourage regular breaks, all with a touch of humor and creativity.

## 📂 What's Inside?

### ✅ `Notify_plyer.py`
A simple script that uses the `plyer` library to send system notifications with a custom title, message, and icon. It's lightweight, easy to run, and ideal for quick reminders during study or work sessions.

### 🖼️ `Notification_tk.py`
Built using Tkinter, this script creates a custom graphical popup window with a cat icon and a funny "shutdown" message. It appears at the center of the screen and auto-closes after a few seconds — perfect for learning basic GUI elements while having fun.

## 💡 Why I Made This

I’m currently brushing up on Python basics, and I love making small, quirky things to reinforce what I learn. These tiny scripts helped me:

- Revisit how modules like `plyer` and `tkinter` work
- Practice image handling with `Pillow`
- Work with GUI windows and screen positioning
- Keep learning fun and relatable!
